# GitVR
### or, "Git 2 : Electric Boogaloo"
### Team Submission for the Clemson University CUHackit 2020 hackathon

Version control is the lifeblood of software development, but also the bane of our existence. Tearful anguish, desolate cries of despair, and much gnashing of teeth are observed when a software developer commits to the master branch -- and we pity the new hire who pushes credentials upstream.

Git visualization is complex, and teaching new developers to use version control requires a new way of thinking. As technology advances we seek to make Git accessible and intuitive to the common user through the use of GitVR, a standalone VR application designed to help users visualize and interact with repositories. Our goal in making GitVR was to pull data directly from the GitHub API and show branches and commits in a 3D graph. Our stretch goal was to make git actions such as merges and pull requests accessible to new users.

We built GitVR in the Unity game engine with a reliance on the SteamVR package and the GitHub Octokit client library for .NET. Our CUHackit 2020 project submission may be viewed at https://devpost.com/software/gitvr.
